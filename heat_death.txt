Heat Death

Am F Am G
I had a dream we watched Orion fade away
When the stars fell off horizons on the threshold
Of where the universe expands a little faster than we can
Together on a blackened ledge above the cold

When our bodies, both such as they were, collided
And the explosions brought together settled out
With your entropy and mine so separate, oh so intertwined
Collapsed to stasis, fell to rest, and doubled down

F Am F Am F Am G --> Am
Let our passions turn to heat and dissipate
Let our beings detach the fire of our designs
Let everything we want or wanted crumble into dust
Let our orbits wander off and then decay
And let us die

All these bodies banging 'round and giving way
That make us who we've found all these years on
And the answers aren't coming, and you'll never find the light
Because the sun slid off our plane before arriving 
into dawn

The dress you wore when we went out that evening
When I saw the child leaping from your eyes
Locked away, forgotten, oubliette'd for the course
The rising chorus of our convolution's joys
Sings "Let us die"

Let your passions turn to heat and dissipate
Let your being detach the fire of your design
May all your comets crash and burn and crumble into dust
May their orbits wander off and then decay

Let our passions turn to heat and dissipate
Let our beings detach the fire of our designs
Let everything we want or wanted crumble into dust
Let our orbits wander off and then decay
And let us die
