Dig

I'm gonna dig
I'm gonna get to the bottom of the hole that I've been carvin in myself
I'm gonna reach right down on through and pull the stitches up from underneath the bottom shelf    
And I'm gonna dig

I'm gonna figure and plan
I'm gonna reach right down on through the pain and then I'll understand
I'm gonna keep just right on reachin, gonna find the thing that tightens down the band             
And then I'll cut the motherfucker out

I'm gonna dig and I'm gonna figure
I'm gonna find the thing just ticklin' on the trigger
I'm gonna pull out all the emptiness and pick it all apart
And oh Hosanna, I'll be whole
And then I'll finally find the bottom of this fucking hole

[break]

I'm gonna pull all the legs off my compassion slowly one by one                                   
I'm gonna watch it squirming limbless on a gurney in the sun
And I'm gonna be the one to tell it when we finally finally meet the night
But then I'm gonna lie and put it down                                                            

I'm gonna pick at all the nodules on my skin                                                      
I'm gonna get 'em all and then I'll finally be the kind of person who can win
I'm gonna be a farmer with a golden field with all the creatures livin' in
And then I'll finally watch 'em rot, but still I'll live                                          

And I'll emerge
Transfigured in flames of battles bravely fought and won
Swollen blackened aura blotting out the sun
Sinews welded to my frame all one-by-one
Hands like shovels gleaming in the fire, formed to ever bury little pieces while The Father strokes his gun 
And I'm gonna dig
And I'm gonna dig
