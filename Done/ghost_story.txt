Ghost Story

I've decided tonight on becoming a ghost
I've decided on being eternal
Someday soon you won't piss in a bar where I've played
Without seeing me there on the urinal

I've decided tonight on becoming a specter
A reaver of innocent, popular souls
I've decided to buck and to gyrate and grind
Against all the tommorrows you callously broke

And darlin' I've decided
To sublimate my form to sound and paper
And darlin' I've decided
To be the only thing you'll ever see or hear about again
I've decided to move through the walls of the bars and the worlds and the pipelines you move in
With the cool and the fair and the others unburdened by sin

I've decided tonight there are things to account for
That can't or won't settle with flowery words
I'm the whispers, the chants, and the hollers and rumors
I'm the curse of the singular, sentient herd

You've decided tonight to forget that I breathe
That the future you're making looks brighter
I know that you've chosen erasure, my dear
Banging 'round chairs, I won't get any quieter

And darlin' I've decided
To sublimate my form to sound and paper
And darlin' I've decided
To be the only thing you'll ever see or hear about again
I've decided to move through the walls of the bars and the worlds and the pipelines you move in
With the cool and the fair and the others unburdened by sin

I've decided tonight that I won't be forgotten
I won't be discarded or cast to the storm
I've decided instead I'm the thing in the creases
And the shadows of faces a-keeping you warm

And darlin' I've decided
To sublimate my form to sound and paper
And darlin' I've decided
To be the only thing you'll ever see or hear about again
I've decided to move through the walls of the bars and the worlds and the pipelines you move in
With the cool and the fair and the others unburdened by sin

I've decided to move through the walls of the bars and the worlds and the circles you move in
With the cool and the fair and the others unburdened by sin
