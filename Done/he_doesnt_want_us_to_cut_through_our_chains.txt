Em, D, Am, D, Em6, Em:      A dash more of scopolomine to make me wonder why my hands bleed in the morning
G, D, Am, D, Em6, Em, C7:   I'll assume it's masturbation not the needles sticking out of everywhere they land
Em, D, Am, D, Em6, Em:      Tripping down the hall staring down the glint of every sharpened surface pointing towards me
G, D, Am, D, C, C-m7M7:     I'll take the morphine with a sixer, and about the lacerations, "I'll be damned?"

(4)Em ->    (1)E5:  Deck the halls
     G,         D
with razor wire sharp and dense
   C9,                 D
to flay the flesh from light 
           Em ->       E5
that tries to find its way into my eyes
                  Em7   Em
--(3)but that was never planned
    G ->                               D5
And scatter broken bottles on where my feet'll find, 
    C9,         D
but If and only if
             Em,    E5
I'm stepping out of line
         D5,                C5,            Em6,            C7
--but my feet are dragging, honey, and the line is made of sand

That piece of gristle on the corner of the table in my bedroom used to be my thigh
But I snagged myself while I was throwing out the condoms in the drawer beside the Word
Now with the rubbers and the crimson words of Jesus on the heap where they are needed
I'll have another double so my wet and throbbing nightmares come up slurred

Deck the halls
with razor wire sharp and dense to flay the flesh from wayward light that tries to find its way into my eyes
--but that was never planned
Glue broken bottles
to the floor In the spots my calloused feet'll find, but If and only if I'm stepping out of line
--but my feet are dragging, bloodied, and the line is made of sand

[Bridge]
(alternate BG and FG vox?)
Em C7 G (fill)
Soon I'm bleeding out and I'll stop trying
Em C7 G B?
Another bag of morphine and I'll sleep and you can use me how you please
Em C7 G (fill)
And leave me with a razor in a bathtub
Em C7 G C EmDim (half-diminished?)
and I'll cut 'em off above the rusty, creaking shackle nice and clean

And deck the halls
with razor wire sharp enough to slice the curves from any light that tries to find its way into my eyes
--a cube of bloody meat ain't so suggestive so the longing doesn't hurt
Glue broken bottles
to the floor In the spots my calloused feet'll find, but If and only if I'm stepping out of line
--but the line's a trail of blood and pus and rye in septic dirt
