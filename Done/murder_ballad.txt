Untitled Murder Ballad

I wasn't shit out with these tattoos on my arms but they're my birthright all the same
Came out all wet and bloody; my little face was just as stoic as could be
But my mother didn't hold me and she didn't even cry
Cause I tore the bitch in half and then she died

Me and dad packed up and left for Detroit to pursue a better life but then he died
I received my happy quarters with a clerically distinguished dad and wife
But she caught him hailing fairest Mary from the prayer team in the night
So she hit him with an iron and he died

Don't tell me no one's watching
From up there in the sky
Cause I've seen him and I know the bastard's name
But you're fool if you don't know it
Like is written in the book
From up there you and me look all the same

So I found a way to make a living and I wish I could say it was a better life
But in between the nightmares and the tremors I just crouched and held my knife
I saw this silver spoon investor and with a black and crimson pinstripe suit
I cut the motherfucker's throat and then he died

Don't tell me no one's watching
From up there in the sky
Cause I've seen him and I know the bastard's name
But you're fool if you don't know it
Like is written in the book
From up there you and me look all the same
All the same
All the same
The robbers and the ones who owe Him fame
All the same
All the same
The wailers and the villians, God is only watching all the same
