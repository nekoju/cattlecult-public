Verse:
They used to call people like me prophets
Maybe took a couple years, but came around
And maybe someday what I'm saying will be written on the walls
But maybe not until this little light burns out

Verse:
They used to call on me to figure who god favored
They used to heed with trembling what I said
But not before they locked me up a lifetime in a tower
And not until the writing couldn't not be read

Chorus:
Ain't no coronation
Ain't no clamoring throng
Ain't no trod down hero's journey
Ain't no celebration for the power of a song
Ain't no singin', Ain't no dancin
Ain't no future, Ain't no cause
And sure as hell I won't be sung by anybody here
Just another fuckin' mouth for you to pause


Verse:
You stack the pyre higher with each cycle that you vote
Without a thought of what you're voting for
The ones who write the story with the pretty words you like
Will carry meat of their intentions to the fore

Verse:
And don't you know oh loving congregation
Who perpetuate the gospel of the sword
The flag you fly means less to the almighty with the cards
With every sycophant of kindness you put forth

Verse:
So stack 'em up like timber
Douse your babes in scented oil
Keep a-smilin' and a-votin'; keep a-sayin' "just one more"
Keep the providence in the flames so tightly loyal

[Chorus]
