(V1)
C9                                                 Em7
    What kind of shit did you have to step over to get to me?
        C7                                  G     D?
Did you miss the tower of cans and stack of dirty magazines?
      C9                           Em7
I can show you how I do it left to mine, my dear
        C7                                G            D?
And I'll get you home by ten if you don't want to stay here

(V2)
C9                           Em7
Check with the ranger at the gate
         C7                                      G              D?
Get your name badge on your breast, affixed, and meet me at the lake
   C9                             Em7
We call it that but really it's a settling pond
                 C7                        G             D?
But it's full of life you'll never find by looking at it wrong

(Chorus)
C                                G
    I'm a barrel full of mercury darling
D                             Em
    I'm an overflowing shitty lagoon
C                                G
    I'm a river full of hydrogen sulfide
D                                  Em
    I'm a picture of a smog-tinted moon
C                                   G
    I'm a burning stack of tires at twilight
D                            Em             
    An impenetrable chlorine haze
C                              G
    A rusty barrel of ammonium nitrate
D                       Em
    I'm a lazy beaurocratic delay

(V3)
C9                                       Em7
    What kind of nature do you expect to see?
       C7                                G                 D?
You'll miss it if you look for something boring, lush, and green
     C9                              Em7
I'll take you over to the fertilizer spill
        C7                                  G               D?
where I take my lunches in the shade of the wrongly colored hill
    C9                                  Em7
The trees grow weird and crooked by the lake
         C7                                      D?
With the animals deformed, and their uncountable legs
       C9                         Em
Do you see the puddle with its iridescent sheen?
       C7                          G     D?
Do you mind its iridescence beyond iridescency?

(Chorus)
I'm a barrel full of mercury darling
I'm an overflowing shitty lagoon
I'm a river full of hydrogen sulfide
I'm a picture of a smog-tinted moon
I'm a burning stack of tires at twilight
An impenetrable chlorine haze
A rusty barrel of ammonium nitrate
I'm a lazy beaurocratic delay
C                                           G
    You'll find tadpoles in the languishing craters
D                            Em                            
    And maybe the occasional frog
C                        G         D
    Just know that I'm a superfund baby
C                D                   Em
    Remediate my landscape all night long


(solo)

(Chorus)
I'm a barrel full of mercury darling
I'm an overflowing shitty lagoon
I'm a river full of hydrogen sulfide
I'm a picture of a smog-tinted moon
I'm a burning stack of tires at twilight
An impenetrable chlorine haze
A rusty barrel of ammonium nitrate
I'm a lazy beaurocratic delay
C                                          G
    If you want to find some beauty you'll find it
D                                       Em
    Succession is a powerful tool
C                    G               D
    And any patch of laurel that you find
           C             D             Em
    It was rooted in the slurry before you

You'll find tadpoles in the languishing craters
And maybe the occasional frog
I told ya I'm a superfund baby
I'll remediate my landscape when you're gone
