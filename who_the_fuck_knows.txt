Who the Fuck Knows?

C                 Em        Am
Does it cause you cognitive dissonance
        Am                 G                 C                F9
When it turns out that the one who said they loved you really didn't?
C                      Em             Am
And does seeing people happy make you angry
             Am                  G            C           F9
Because your parents fought that Saturday and ruined your fucking picnic?
            C           Em        Am
And does it make it any easier to swallow
     Am                        G         D                 C
Your pointless fucking fate to know it's fucking pointless anyway?
    C         Em          Am     G
And will your lawyer even show?
             C
Who the fuck knows?

C                 Em        Am
Would I be doing any differently
        Am                 G                 C                F9
If someone hadn't told me time and again I'm just emotionally indulgent?
C                      Em             Am
And do I owe them for fulfilling
             Am                  G            C           F9
What I'd never do without another just and proper scolding?
            C           Em        Am
An really is there any telling
     Am                        G         D                 C
What else would I be saying and what rates would I be paying
    C         Em          Am     G
For the camaro and the nanny and the clothes?
             C
Who the fuck knows?

           Am                         Em
Well we're all in this infernal thing together
          C                             Em
And every parallel dimension's probably fucked
              C              Em              C          G
So instead of fretting on my scars I'm gonna fret on my guitar
              C                G               C
Gonna drink a beer and write a song and give a fuck

C                 Em        Am
Does it cause me cognitive dissonance
        Am                 G                 C                F9
To be so proudly humanistic but so petty when I'm writing?
C                      Em             Am
Yes it does; I do it anyway
             Am                  G            C           F9
Cause I don't sleep a lot the nights I'm down and I don't feel like fighting
            C           Em        Am
all the ghosts that I've collected 
      Am                        G         D                 C
That keep me otherwise from living as a drone who's ever giving
    C         Em          Am     G
of her body and of her mind and of her soul
             C
Who the fuck knows?

           Am                         Em
Well the universe ain't got a lot of answers
          C                             Em
But it's got a lot of questions you can ask
              C              Em              C          G
That are better for you mind than what the light of what's behind
              C                G               C
Has got to show you bout the shadows of your past

           Am                         Em
Well we're all in this infernal thing together
          C                             Em
And every parallel dimension's probably fucked
              C              Em              C          G
So instead of fretting on my scars I'm gonna fret on my guitar
              C                G               C
Gonna drink a beer and write a song and give a fuck
              C              Em              C          G
And instead of lilting backlit shadows cast by all my rotten luck
              C                G               C
Gonna have a beer with someone else who gives a fuck
