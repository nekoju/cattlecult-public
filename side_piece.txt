Side Piece

[Verse]

C, G, C, F, C, G, C
Well your life is too in order and it could use some fucking up. Just shoot a text and I'll be happy to oblige
C, G, C, F, C, G, C
If the one you're cuddlin' up to isn't giving any up well that's a shame but I can warm you up tonight
F, C, G, C
As long it's it's ok with him or her or it or they I'm on the phone and I'll be waiting here alright
F, C, G, C
To drive on up this evening and deliver what you need cuz I'm your side piece

C, G, C, F, C, G, C
So you've got some things in place and it's all working how you wanted and you need to see the light to lift you up
C, G, C, F, C, G, C
Keep believin if you want you've got it sorted but you've only built an artifice of meat and cum and blood
F, C, G, C
If you meet me at the notary I'll sign section 7a and we'll be off and we'll having lots of fun
F, C, G, C
If the section that I signed says what you're really looking for's a side piece

Dm, F, C, G
Well do you want another Very Special Someone who can won't impose upon you anything you couldn't otherwise have planned?
Dm, F, C, G
Do you want someone who's mad enough to have a little fun but won't talk shit when you get bored or overwhelmed and cut and run? 
Dm, F, C, G
Someone who's a looker and will turn a couple heads? And someone you can ditch and they'll just take it on the chin 
F, C, G, C
If the thing who checks your boxes matches all of the above
F, C, G, C
You're not looking for a lover darlin what you're really looking for's a side piece

So you got a healthy life and it could use some fucking up. You're well adjusted so I'm sure you'll manage fine.
If the one you're cuddlin' up to isn't giving any up then, babe, I'm sure the problem's on the other line
As long it's it's ok with him or her or it or they just send me packing with my shit and never mind
You're absolved and you don't owe a fucking thing cuz I was always just a side piece

F, C, G
I felt conflicted when I wrote this little number
F, D, C (As f shape at 3)
About the pettiness this narrative brings
F, C, G
But it's not petty 'less it's personal, darling
F, D, D#, G
But it's general; people like you do these things

(Em Bm C)?
Here's to hoping that you never get a sit-down with the man behind the desk
Here's to hoping those policy violations never catch up
Here's to hoping the vultures of middle management never catch on
Here's to hoping that your someone isn't only tryin to find a better side piece

Dm, F, C, G
Well do you want another Very Special Someone who can won't impose upon you anything you couldn't otherwise have planned?
Dm, F, C, G
Do you want someone who's mad enough to have a little fun but won't talk shit when you get bored or overwhelmed and cut and run? 
Dm, F, C, G
Someone who's a looker and will turn a couple heads? And someone you can ditch and they'll just take it on the chin 
Dm, F, C, G
Let me grab the application from the desk and bring it by cause I really wanna be
G, C, G, C
your fawning, weeping, crushing, lovely, ever-needing, slightly bleeding 
in the margins, one-and-only special side piece
