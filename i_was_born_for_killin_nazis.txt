I was born for killin' Nazis

Honey I was born for killin' Nazis
I was born to crush their silly little heads
I was born put on combat boots with rainbow-colored laces
And I was born to stomp those motherfuckers dead

Baby I was born for killin' fascists
I was born to never wanna be just like 'em
born to put on sparkly heels and pull those Nazi beytsim out
And put 'em on the sidewalk there and spike 'em

And darlin' I was born for wrecking institutions
Built on bloody, black basaltic, sand
And I'm born for askin' all the well-behaved progressives
"Did civility work out as you had planned?"

I was born for breakin' white supremacy
Even in the places you don't see it best
I was born for blowing reefer right into your granny's face
Every time the dusty housefrau can object

And baby I was born for killin' Nazis
Like all the ones with flagpoles used to do
They'd meet 'em on the battlefield and shoot 'em in the heads
But now they all meet up and have a brew
