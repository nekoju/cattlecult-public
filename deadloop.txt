  C               G
 Always gonna be lonely
                 C
 Always gonna be sad
                 G
 Always gonna be thinkin bout the things that I don't have
              C
 Always gonna clumsy
                 G
 Always gonna be dumb
                     C
 Always gonna always gonna write songs too overwrought too much to mean a fuck
                 E7
 Always gonna be sorry
                  F
 Always gonna feel wrong
             E7            F                C           E7 Am G
 Always gonna wonder where I'll end up when I screw the fucking dog

 C
 Always
               E7
 gonna say I'm never
             F
 Gonna be as clever 
       C                G
 as my dad wanted me to be
      C
 but after all
          E7
 I'm doing better
          F               D
 than the dice's snakeyes see 
    C
 so whatever quantum
  E7
 bullshit is or isn't
 F
 happening in my brain
C, E7, Gaug
 Fuck the expectations
                      C
 And oh yeah fuck the state

 Fuck being lonely
 Fuck being sad
 Fuck wondering bout the opportunities I did or didn't have
 Fuck feeling clumsy
 Fuck feeling dumb and
 Fuck feeling like the words I write are dealing empty hands
 Fuck being sorry
 Fuck being wrong and
 Fuck all the condescending bastards who will never understand

 Cuz I'm a multitude        
 containing
 Absent-minded
 fucking klutz
 And some of
 all those vectors 
 sure enough point elsewhere
 than but up
 But wherever the 
 bag of cold cuts leads me
 that will maybe lay my fate
 Fuck the expectations...
 And oh yeah fuck the state

(solo, chorus progression)

 Always
 gonna say I'm never
 Gonna be as clever 
 as my dad wanted me to be
 but after all
 I'm doing better
 than the dice's snakeyes see 
 so whatever quantum
 bullshit is or isn't
 happening in my brain
 Fuck the expectations
 And while we're at it fuck the state
