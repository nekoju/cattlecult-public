A knife between friends
-------------------

F9: x33010
I play the Fm - G in the end of the chorus as x331xx x554xx
Am hammers on d-e and b-c
C hammers on d-e

Am, C, Am, C, G 
(V1)
Am                C
You came down and out
Am.                     C.               G
Not knowing where you'd be or what you'd be without
Am.                  C
Being full of pity's quite a way to live
Am.                     C.              G                  
So of course I told you off the cuff to come on in

Am, C, Am, C, F, Em
(V2)
Am.                    C
Up front, I'm a Jew
Am.                                                              C.                                              G
Just the kind your mom would like and not the kind who runs the news
Am.                             C
So I was just a little scared
Am.                                 C.                                                G
When you started shouting, raving that I'd better be prepared

(chorus--no break)
Am.            C.      F9( Cadd4)
What's a knife between friends?
Am.                   C.              F9
What's a kindness to be done and what's a trouble to preempt?
Am.              C.       F9
What's a person? Who's a problem?
Am.                             C.            Fm.          G
And why does the means deal the same stack of cards as the ends?

Am, C, Am, C, G x2
Am, C, F Em (?) x2?

(V2)
I feel resentment twisting in my chest
Kinda like a knife I guess but doubtful it compares
Moral angst hits differently, beloved
When the person in the mirror is a shill who isn't buying her own wares

(Chorus)
What's a knife between friends?
What's a kindness to be done and what's a trouble to preempt?
What's a person? Who's a problem?
And when does the means deal the same stack of cards as the ends?

(Outro)
Am, C, G
Am, F, Em
"What are we doing and why did we come?"
I asked two enforcers of order (undone)

To the magistrate: "What is this thing, affidavit?"
"Just irregular apathetic, atomic vibration" 
"What's a libelous roommate? what's a murderous spouse?"
The Clerk replied, "They're just the same except whose name is on the house"

Am, C, G
I repeated before heaven "Why did I come?"
Am, F, Em
"What makes us blush and what makes us feel numb?"
Am, Caug, G
"What hope? What's desolation? What makes someone a mother?"
Am, F, Em
"Just bags full of chemicals bumping into each other"
