I'm not cut out for the social enterprise in ways that parallel not climbing mountains
And there's no shame in not contributing to political or alpine slow decay
But I'll be damned if this here game I'm playing winds up paying out what I put in it
And there's no shame in just not knowing that this ain't the kind of game that you just play

But the pros go drink and fraternize and leave together stumbling home and holding hands
And I'm just sitting here like Attenborough watching through my third or seventh beer
And the way she looks at her while she's just looking round the room is saying something
Bout the winners and the losers and the ones who're wisely choosin' not to care
Well I'm really trying not to care

And every time you saw me having fun babe, you should know that I was faking it
Inside my mind I was just waiting for its slow and steady, bloody end
And I'm seeing all you joyful libertines out in the bars at night just making it
And I can't help hoping that you're faking for your friends

So maybe someday you might see me out about somewhere round town again with business
You might even smile and do that thing that bashful Hoosiers call a wave
Know in advance that thing I said when I was drinking at that thing the other evening
It wasn't true and frankly knowing you's a waste!
That's not true; I'm not that edgy and I don't hate you
I'm really only trying not to care

And every time you saw me having fun babe, you should know that I was faking it
Inside my mind I was just waiting for its slow and steady, stumbling grizly end
And I'm seeing all you joyful libertines out in the bars at night just making it
And I can't help hoping that you're faking for your friends

Well you've heard that olden story of the one who made up wings
Of candle wax and feathers, those preposterous monstrosities
Flying ever higher for the hubris that he gleaned
(Or with a smirk not heeding all the boundaries of his being)
And so he splashed into the ground, his artifice dissolved into its host
I've been here on this couch an hour.
And that candle on the table's getting pretty fucking low.

And the wings I've put together of my wit and clout and felt
Dissolve into a similarly melting sense of self
And I'll laugh another hour, take it with a grain of salt
When the one who doesn't like the one who made the joke can laugh despite himself
The Artifice and Icarus miasma'd on the ground, father shouted
"Did you touch it? Was it worth it?"
But he didn't hear a sound

And every time you saw me having fun babe, you should know that I was faking it
Inside my mind I just avoided being rude
And I'm seeing all you joyful libertines out in the bars at night just making it
And I can't help hoping that you're faking it too
